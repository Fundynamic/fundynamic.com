# Fundynamic
The homepage of Fundynamic (http://www.fundynamic.com) is open-sourced here.

(Of course) I build my own website and while I do so I learn new things. Like `grunt`, `bower`, throw in some `bootstrap` and so forth. Its a great learning experience and at the same time benifitial for me in multiple ways.

Feel free to fork/clone/etc this branch.

## Getting started
Make sure you have `npm` installed. See https://www.npmjs.org/

Make sure you have `Grunt` installed. See http://gruntjs.com/getting-started

Make sure you have `bower` installed. See http://bower.io/ -- or `npm install -g bower`

After your dependencies are set up, run:
`npm install`


## Development
Simply run `grunt watch` and start developing, and view results from `build/*`.
